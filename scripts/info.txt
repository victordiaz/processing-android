Collection of utility scripts that I put here for the lack of a better place. They 
probably should become tasks/targets in the gradle/ant build scripts at some point.

compat-update.sh: generates the appcompat zip file containing the appcompat v7 package
found in the Android SDK's extras folder

gvrsdk-update.sh: downloads the Google VR SDK and generates all required packages and jar
files needed to build and run cardboard sketches from Processing

perm-parse.py: generates the array of permissions for a given SDK level, to be pasted in
Permissions.java

wear-update.sh: downloads the wearable aar file from a known maven repository, and 
extracts the classes jar and copies it inside core/library
